# GENUARY?

GENUARY is an artificially generated month of time where we build code that makes beautiful things.

It happens during the month of January in 2021.

For every 24 hour day of this 744 hour timespan, we have prepared a prompt with instructions for you to execute.

You don't have to follow the prompt exactly. Or even at all. But it would be nice if it was vaguely related.

You can use any language, framework or medium. But please respect the Geneva Conventions.

Tag your works with #genuary and #genuary2021. If you're going to misspell it as #genaury, please include all permutations.

# [PROMPTS IN PROGRESS](prompts)

Click for the [prompts in progress](prompts). These are not the actual real prompts because we still have to make a selection, which we will publish in due time. If you decided to cheat and implement all these prompts before the start of January 2021, that would actually be pretty impressive.

# TIPS & TRICKS

* If you're short on time, you can try and work two prompts in a program that you use twice. The power of automation.
* Don't get burned out doing dailies. This is supposed to be fun and a creative impulse. Don't give up too quickly, but if you start resenting it, or find it's stunting you creatively, then stop for a moment and think about why you're doing this again. Fun? Practicing skills? Learning? Boredom? Ideas? It's fine to skip days. Though if you've been on a streak and only got like three days left, maybe consider hanging in there; you've got this.
* There's a prompt for each day, but you can do them in advance (or later!) if it's convenient. No one is here to throw off your schedule.
