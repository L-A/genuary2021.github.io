# PROMPTS IN PROGRESS

Here follows an unordered list of interesting code prompts.

Prompts do not have to be followed exactly. In particular, code snippets should be considered language-agnostic pseudocode algorithmic suggestions.

1. (2)

This one is roughly based on the October challenge from [symbiocene.art](https://symbiocene.art).

```
// uppercase INPUT can be your own variables or expression
// INPUT_A is generally between 0.0 and 1.0
x += (INPUT_X - x) * INPUT_A;
y += (INPUT_Y - y) * INPUT_A;
```

---
2. (7)

```
// TRIPLE NESTED LOOP
```

---
3. (1)

```
for successive values of T:
    Y = X XOR T
```

---
4. (6)

```
10 SEARCH FOR "ENO'S OBLIQUE STRATEGIES"
20 OBTAIN ONE
30 THAT IS YOUR PROMPT FOR TODAY

<b style="background-color: #264653">#264653</b>
<b style="background-color: #2a9d8f">#2a9d8f</b>

Optionally, you can use a black or white background.
