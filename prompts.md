# PROMPTS IN PROGRESS

Here follows an unordered list of interesting code prompts.

Prompts do not have to be followed exactly. In particular, code snippets should be considered language-agnostic pseudocode algorithmic suggestions.

---

This one is roughly based on the October challenge from [symbiocene.art](https://symbiocene.art).

```
// uppercase parts can be your own variables
// INPUT_A is generally between 0 and 1.0
let trackX = INPUT_X - x;
x += trackX * INPUT_A;
let trackY = INPUT_Y - y;
y += trackY * INPUT_A;
```

---

```
// TRIPLE NESTED LOOP
```

---

```
for successive values of T:
    Y = X XOR T
```

---

```
10 SEARCH FOR "ENO'S OBLIQUE STRATEGIES"
20 OBTAIN ONE
30 THAT IS YOUR PROMPT FOR TODAY
```

```
// TREE
```

```
function f(x) { 
    DRAW(x); 
    f(1*x/4); 
    f(2*x/4); 
    f(3*x/4); 
}
```

---

Make a grid of all the permutations of something
