# GENUARY 2021 - PROMPTS IN PROGRESS

Here follows an unordered list of interesting code prompts

---

this one is roughly based on the current October challenge from symbiocene.art

```
// uppercase parts can be your own variables
// INPUT_A is generally between 0 and 1.0
let trackX = INPUT_X - x;
x += trackX * INPUT_A;
let trackY = INPUT_Y - y;
y += trackY * INPUT_A;
```

---

```// TRIPLE NESTED LOOP```

---

```
for successive values of T:
    Y = X XOR T
```

---

```
10 SEARCH FOR "ENO'S OBLIQUE STRATEGIES"
20 OBTAIN ONE
30 THAT IS YOUR PROMPT FOR TODAY
```
