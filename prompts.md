# PROMPTS IN PROGRESS

Here follows an unordered list of interesting code prompts.

Prompts do not have to be followed exactly. In particular, code snippets should be considered language-agnostic pseudocode algorithmic suggestions.

---

This one is roughly based on the October challenge from [symbiocene.art](https://symbiocene.art).

```
// uppercase INPUT can be your own variables or expression
// INPUT_A is generally between 0.0 and 1.0
x += (INPUT_X - x) * INPUT_A;
y += (INPUT_Y - y) * INPUT_A;
```

---

```
// TRIPLE NESTED LOOP
```

---

```
for successive values of T:
    Y = X XOR T
```

---

```
10 SEARCH FOR "ENO'S OBLIQUE STRATEGIES"
20 OBTAIN ONE
30 THAT IS YOUR PROMPT FOR TODAY
```

---

No loops

---

Circles only

---

500 lines

---

Any shape, none can touch

---

Gradients without lines

---

Text as primitive shape

---

```
// TREE
```

---

```
// SUBDIVISION

<b style="background-color: #264653">#264653</b>
<b style="background-color: #2a9d8f">#2a9d8f</b>
<b style="background-color: #e9c46a">#e9c46a</b>
<b style="background-color: #f4a261">#f4a261</b>
<b style="background-color: #e76f51">#e76f51</b>, no gradients. 

Optionally, you can use a black or white background.

```
function f(x) { 
    DRAW(x); 
    f(1 * x / 4); 
    f(2 * x / 4); 
    f(3 * x / 4); 
}
```

---

Make a grid of all the permutations of something

---

Monochrome gradient without lines

---

```
.5 + .5 * 5 ** .5
```

---

Draw a line, pick a new color, move a bit

---

Do not repeat.

---

Small areas of symmetry.

---

Place shapes. Alter the ones that overlap. Repeat.

---

Generate some rules, then follow them by hand on paper.
