# PROMPT SELECTION ALGORITHM

We are going to attempt simulated annealing inspired sorting with a group :)

I put all the prompts in this Google Doc.

Currently all of them are below the selection line.

## DEFINE STEP

1. Move one prompt you like above the selection line.
2. LET N = Number of prompts above the selection line.
3. IF N > 31, move N - 31 prompts you like the least below the selection line.

## ROUND ONE

Everybody performs 8 steps.

## ROUND TWO

Everybody performs 4 steps.

## ROUND THREE

Everybody performs 2 steps

## ROUND FOUR

Everybody performs 1 final step.
